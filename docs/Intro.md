## Conductor

Conductor is a package of scripts that are intended to work well with Composer
and compliment aspects of its use. I don't think they're worth inclusion
in Composer _directly_, but I felt like some people would run into a need
for them often enough that it was worth having a package of them somewhere.

### Contributing

Please let me know via Issues or Github pull requests of things that you feel
would be relatively common tasks that can hook into the Composer pre/post 
install/update system.
